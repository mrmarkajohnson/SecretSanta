# Secret Santa

This is work in progress!

# Purpose

This project was designed for various purposes:
1. As an actual Secret Santa tool for my family (and in the future, anyone else) to use
2. To show some of my existing coding skills and knowledge
3. To try new or more up-to-date tools, packages and libraries
4. To experiment with different solution approaches, structures, patterns etc.
5. To make sure I can actually create a new solution from scratch

# How To Use Secret Santa

This section needs to be completed...

# Decisions I Made

I've sometimes decided to try a different approach to what I'm use to, to see what happens!  That included using:
- Standard JavaScript where possible, as I was rusty (although JQuery was already embedded)
- ASP.NET Identity and User Secrets (for development) but with my own modifications
- Encryption of usernames, e-mails and security answers to keep future users safe, e.g. if this is cloned
- Base classes that extend to the view models, to try to avoid DTOs with lots of replication
- Entity Framework Core, as I'd only used EF6 before
- Bootstrap 5, as I was used to Bootstrap 3
