<h1>Manage Your Relationships</h1>

<div class="row @CenterFlexNoWrapContainer">

    <div class="mb-5 mt-2 align-items-center justify-content-center align-content-center">
        <p>
            Here you can tell Santa if you are - or were - in a relationship with another group member.
        </p>
        <p>
            Santa isn't nosy, he's only interested so that you can avoid exchanging Secret Santa gifts with your current or ex-partner, if you want to.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your relationship didn't work out, Santa's very sorry, but you can still avoid exchanging Secret Santa gifts for as long as you need.
